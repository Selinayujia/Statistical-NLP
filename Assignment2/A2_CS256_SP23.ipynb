        "I used a nested for loop to loop over a couple reasonable value of learning rates( from 5e-1 to 5e-19), and some adam_epsilon values (from 1e-1 to 1e-19). From this process, I found the default learning rate produces the biggest accuracy, and by increasing the epoch to 10 and decreasing the adam_epsilon values to 1e-7. Since the epochs means the one complete iteration over the entire dataset during training, I noticed that after 5 epochs, the loss hasn't stop decreasing, so it is not converged yet to optimal soltion, that is why I increase the epoch to 10. For adam_epsilon value, since the dataset I worked on is pretty small, so I tuned this parameter a bit to make sure the gradient 's fluctuation won't affect the result. The validation result is 0.96 accuracy and the actual test result is 0.91 accuracy, so there is no significant discrepancy between test and validation accuracy. I think this difference here is mostly due to a slight overfitting to a small dataset. "

This is good practice for your final project. **Write some code** in the below code cell to print out the text five test set examples that your model gets **wrong**.

If your model gets fewer than five examples wrong, please design five test examples that fool your model (i.e., *adversarial examples*). Then, in the following text cell, perform a qualitative analysis of these examples.

I think the mistake is due to this small training dataset, it is hard to predict these vocabulary, especially short phrases meaning without seeing recurring example. So increase training dataset size will be a way to improve this. Another point I noticed is that a lot of verb with sentiments are with past tense. Maybe while processing training data, we can do some pre-processing to handle tense so a same verb in a training set can be learned more effectively. \n"
